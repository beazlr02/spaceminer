A basic physics engine

The lander has MASS
The lander starts at speed ZERO
The lander accepts a command to fire a thruster
Move from method call per second to a ticking clock
There is GRAVITY to apply constant force
The thruster slows the lander down

The lander has height above the ground and reports that height as it changes

The lander reports SPEED to an observer
